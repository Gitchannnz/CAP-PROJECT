          <p class="fs-6 fw-medium mb-4">Income Generation Program (IGP) is committed to supporting communities by offering a range of school products and other initiatives aimed at fostering economic growth and self-sufficiency. Our primary focus is to equip schools, students, and educational institutions with high-quality, affordable products while creating sustainable income opportunities for local producers and entrepreneurs.</p>
          <p class="mb-4">Through our IGP initiative, we collaborate with local artisans, small-scale manufacturers, and community groups to produce and supply essential school items such as uniforms, stationery, and learning materials. By engaging these local communities in the production process, we not only ensure that schools have access to much-needed resources but also provide a vital income stream for families and individuals..</p>

              <p class="mb-3">Our mission is twofold: to support education by making critical learning tools accessible and to empower communities by promoting local production and entrepreneurship. We believe that education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty, and through IGP, we contribute to this cause by driving both educational and economic development.</p>

              <p class="mb-3">Beyond school products, our initiatives extend to other income-generating activities, including vocational training programs, skill-building workshops, and business mentorship for individuals looking to start or grow their enterprises. Our goal is to foster an ecosystem where education and entrepreneurship thrive hand in hand, leading to long-term prosperity.</p>
